# Impact-of-Bilingual-Students-in-Enrollment-and-Other-factors-

Project Overview 

This project aims to analyze the impact of enrollment in educational programs and the overall student diversity by comparing English Language Learners (ELLs) and Non-English Language Learners (Non-ELLs). The study will focus on how ELL status correlates with enrollment in special programs, demographic diversity, and other relevant factors.
